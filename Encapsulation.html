							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Encapsulation is a concept where related data is grouped together and the data is then restricted. The two main ideas of data restriction are public and private. These adjectives can refer to both attributes and methods. Public means that the attribute or method can be accessed by an instance of a class. Private means that the attribute or method can only be accessed by the class itself.</p>
							<p>For example, in default Python does not restrict the attributes of classes see the below example of non restricted assess to data in a class.</p>
							<span class="image fit"></span><img src="images/Encapsulation 1.jpg" alt="Public attributes" /></span>
							<p></p>
							<p>No error messages are thrown up. The data in the Phone class is public by default, and any instance of the Phone class can change it's attributes.</p>
							<p>Having unrestricted data can cause problems in code. For example in this case if nonsense attributes were given to the Phone class they would still be accepted increasing the potential for problems and errors in the program.</p>
							<span class="image fit"></span><img src="images/Encapsulation 2.jpg" alt="Public attributes gone wrong" /></span>
							<p>Python relies on convention to signify private methods and attributes. A single "_" underscore before each instance of a method or attribute shows it is private and any programmer should treat it as such.</p>
							<span class="image fit"></span><img src="images/Encapsulation 3.jpg" alt="Private attributes" /></span>
							<p>The __dict__ attribute stores all the attributes of an object in Python. Here it has printed the attributes including the underscore. However this is just a convention to show a method or attribute is private, the Python code itself does not enforce any restrictions to make these attributes private.</p>
							<p>Double underscores can give an approximation of a private attribute. In the example below, without the helper method, if the __private_method was called in it's place an error message would have shown, however the helper_method allows this method to be called outside it's class. Double underscores are to promote Encapsulation, the setup is to avoid name collision in inheritance.</p>
