							<p>I began the Secure Software Development (SSD) module intrigued about course's content. Cyber Security and Secure Software were still abstract concepts to me – something for the professionals to handle. Now, I end this module with a knowledge of how critical a component of software development security is, how easily and often it is overlooked in the software development life cycle and how costly vulnerabilities in software can be. It was sobering to discovering the extent to which new vulnerabilities are being discovered, that modern day software is often released insecure, and that people take advantage of that to launch attacks – often seeking to monetise these cyber attacks causing huge damage. However, it was also inspiring to learn of those who are willing to dedicate themselves to making others safer on the web such as Google's Project Zero mission whose aim is to help discover Zero-day vulnerabilities before the bad guys do, and also to discover a wealth of knowledge available for those with the will to make computer systems safer. Critically for me, I feel I finish the course with a knowledge and awareness of security to take into any project I embark on in the future.</p>
							
							<p>The SSD module introduced a big new change – team group work. I was hesitant about this new aspect. I am a novice programmer, and have struggled to get my code operating on many occasions – basically I didn't want to be the lame duck. Soon our teams were released and I met my new team. It was great to be communicating with my course mates. We were able to communicate well despite the time zone difference myself (in Guangzhou, China) and Wang (in Singapore) and the rest in the UK. There were bumps, sometimes my VPN played up, other times when UK based team member couldn't get off work in time to make a meeting which was early enough for Wang and I. However, the design document project was excellent. Maya got the ball rolling and we gradually built up a decent design for our project built around security. I took care of the SQL injection as I had been researching it for the discussion and was really getting interested in how it worked and I wanted to learn more. Next was the bigger project – the coding output and I was feeling myself becoming overwhelmed.</p>
							
							<p>This year has not paned out as I expected. I expected China's zero covid policy to be overwhelmed by new highly contagious strains of Covid-19. I expected my work to be paused for lengthy periods as the country battled mass infections. However, ever tightening epidemic controls kept a lid on it albeit at an enormous cost. For my situation, this hugely increase my burden at work. As colleagues in Shanghai were unable to go to the office for months, colleagues in Guangzhou packed up and left. And at an important stage of my team's project development I dropped the ball because I was too burnt out to struggle with coding, I wanted to wait until my day off before I looked at it, and in that time my team made great progress which I wasn't a part of.</p> 
							
							<p>At this point, I spoke candidly one-on-one with one of my teammates, we both shared our struggles and how difficult we found the course at times. I'm grateful to her for reaching out, this really helped me to get over my sense of sinking and to get back on track with the project. So I took on the responsibility of organising and leading the group presentation for our code demonstration. This turned out to be one of the highlights of the module for me– we were all nervous before the presentation but there was great camaraderie and eventually joy once we finished and felt we'd done a decent job.</p> 
							
							<p>I said in the reflection in my previous module that I wanted to stay on top of my tasks. I feel I made some improvement in that regard which I feel is reflected in my e portfolio which this module has more artefacts, mini reflections for certain tasks, and I hope more diverse and cleaner presentation. I was able to achieve this simply by adding more to the portfolio as I went along instead of a mad rush in the last couple of weeks. Improvements can be made in terms of providing more evidence of coding and reflections on reading material. On occasions I worked on a given unit but neglected to make any records for example I worked on the Tower of Hanoi task and found it fascinating but I didn't document my work. I would like to have taken part in the seminars and missed the chance to do so, I watched the recording of them but earlier times were organised but being so used to late starts they slipped me by, but I appreciate the opportunity I was given and would do differently given the chance again. Doing this module again, I would strive to make more time for study, whether that be by discipline or cutting back on work. Still it has given me great opportunities, like simply talking with Wang who works as software engineer to hear his level of knowledge and listen to some of his experiences was a valuable lesson. </p>
							
							<p>Looking forward, I have grown in confidence as a result of this module, an example from my e-portfolio which shows my progress best is the Simple Python Shell. I was able to handle some of the coding, testing and understand the security aspects. I have the believe to continue with my study. But before I would consider tackling the Post Grad Diploma I need to improve my coding skill and understandings of design concepts through practice. I already have an idea for a project to build – an API to store resources to help my nephew learn Chinese characters. Now I know it's not enough to just be concerned with functionality, I will also need to adopt a security mindset during any development cycle.</p>
