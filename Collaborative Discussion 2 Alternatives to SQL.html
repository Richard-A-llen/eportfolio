							<h2>Initial post</h2>
								
							<p>Dealing with increasing amounts of data NoSQL databases are rising up to challenge the dominate relational databases. Most rational database systems fail to reach the scalability and flexibility required for big data. One such alternative are document-oriented databases such as MangoDB which works on the principle of storing data in 'documents' rather than in strictly defined tables. Data from the databases can be aggregated to get them into a searchable, organised form. In MangoDB documents are value/key pairs that serve as the basic data unit, each database contains collections , themselves holding documents – each document is different and can have a variable number of fields. An advantage of using this kind of database design is that data does not need to be normalised like it would in a rational database. This is an advantage because the constrains caused by normalisation can degrade the performance of a database overtime. (Margot, 2021)</p>
							<p>Modelling the data in terms of database structure is focused on the needs of the user. However, one issue with NoSQL data bases is that designing schema for NoSQL databases can be challenging because NoSQL has no standard modelling method. (Hamouda, 2017).</p>

							<h2> Peer response </h2>
							
							<p>This lead me to look into hardware architecture for NoSQL. The architecture NoSQL systems run on is very different from the traditional system. Because they are more distributed the data is spread out across many storage nodes, possibly even thousands of them.(Preston, 2016) A storage node is a physical (or virtual machine) with it's own storage. An interesting feature of Oracle which is also a key/value based NoSQL database system, is that the database contain replication nodes which are organised into shares. A master share is responsible for what the data base writes, and copies to other replication shards (which are read-only). More replication shards allows faster read throughput, because there are more machines to respond to read requests – or just able to handle a large volumes of data at peak times. On the flip the more replication the slower the write times in the database as more data needs to be copied (Oracle, N.D.).</p>

							<h2> Summary Post </h2>
							
							<p>The reason why modelling can be considered important in database design and development are varied. Although it differs, this importance applies to NoSQL and SQL databases. Firstly it helps with the conceptual and logical design phase of a project, then it helps give a structure to the process during coding and development, importantly modelling allows the designer of the project to describe describe the application from various perspectives and at various levels of abstraction (Atzeni et al, 2020).</p>
							
							<p>It is important to remember although NoSQL databases don't have the ridge schema of a relational database they still have an underlying structure to how they store the data – the details of how the data is organised may be flexible but to refer to NoSQL as “schema-less” is misleading (MongoBD,N.D.).</p>
							
							<p>As the primary use of NoSQL databases are in systems with intensive reading and writing, the schema structure of an NoSQL database is not known in advance, instead it is flexible and adjusts to the incoming record structure. Databases need to be flexible in systems where horizontal scalability is required. (Bjeladinovic, 2018)</p>
							
							<p>The main characteristic of SQL such as query language support, the security provided by ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transaction support, as well as the ability to conform to a strictly designed schema; and NoSQL's scalability to support big data applications including huge web bases systems suggests that both SQL and NoSQL will both continue to be present in the market, even working together supporting the same system.</p>
