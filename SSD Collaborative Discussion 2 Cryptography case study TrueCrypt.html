							<h2>Initial post</h2>

							<p>Truecrypt was developed anonymously, little is known about the team behind the code. In 2012 the U.S. National Security Agency's listed Truecrypt as one of the three “biggest threats to its ability to intercept Internet traffic and interpret other information it acquires” (Sayer , 2014). Often shrouded in mystery TrueCrypt became a key point in several international investigations - revelations that it was used by Edward Snowden and that it was ISIS's favoured encryption tool brought the software notoriety (Ratliff, 2016).</p>

							<p>In April 2012 a source code audit gave TrueCrypt a relatively positive review for it's security aspects yet just weeks later in May 2012 TrueCrypt's developers announced they were abandoning the project and left warning for users that the software was insecure (Sayer, 2014). Users were told to migrate their encrypted files over to other forms of encryption and were given details on how to do so.</p>

							<p>The software has an intriguing story behind it but ultimately now I would not recommend anyone to use Truecrypt despite it still being available to find online - the official download pages have been removed and support for the software has ended. An important aspect of software lifecycle is patching bugs and vulnerabilities and especially for a security minded project such as Truecrypt which has had at least 11 vulnerabilities identified including potential backdoors it is imperative for users and organisations to migrate to other available alternatives (Junestam & Guigo, 2014).</p>
