							<h2>Reflection</h2>

							<p>The object oriented information systems (OOIS) module began and ended with thoughts about information systems, we looked back to the past to where things when wrong and we considered the present with the emergence of new information systems. The cycle made me realise there are still so many challenges to over come, it's sobering to think how much damage information system failure can cause. I learnt from my classmates fascinating example that the success of an information system and the reliability of code can mean the difference between life and death. And looking to the future and how we will come to rely on these systems more this relationship will surely become ever more vital. With ever more technology relying on systems, and the safety and security of people will inevitably be entrusted to these systems. </p>
							
							<p>This brings me onto myself and the object oriented method of programming, which takes advantage of methods such as classes, attributes, inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism. At the start of the module I was still filled with interpretation about what OOIS was. I do not have a programming background I am learning along with the course. I did not know how any one of these core functions worked. At the start of April an outbreak of Covid-19 caused almost all of my work to be cancelled. I threw myself into learning about these core concepts. I had bought a hardcopy of Phillips D's Object-Oriented Programming at the beginning of the course to accompany my e-book library. I used Codio which I often find awkward to use and which lacks any accompanying explanation for when I hit a wall – I found YouTube a great resource full of helpful explanations.</p>
							
							<p>At the time I had no knowledge of how long my time off work would last but it ended abruptly late April and I returned to work full time – with added pressure to meet built up demand. At this period I was learning about UML and database modelling. I found the concept of normalisation difficult to grasp at first. I had to learn the steps of first, second then third normalisation and then try apply the concept myself. I had the benefit of seeing some of my classmates object models, however I try to rely on my own understanding, I created my tables normalised to the third form – a failure on my part to understand how the primary key operated in the third form caused me to create a faulty table. I realised my error when creating the supermarket class diagram in Unit 5 after reflection on my work and help from studying with my classmates. </p>
							
							<p>This mistake and these kinds of mistakes in the practical application of the concepts I was learning came to typify my output. I found both the system design assignment a great learning experience but on my diagram, and as my feedback pointed out I showed some confusion between composition and inheritance and also when methods were required to be included. The mistakes put me in a stronger position for the system implementation project. What I enjoyed about the system implementation project was that I realised how far I had come in my understanding of Object-Oriented programming. I was creating classes and attributes confidently. I still however found the overall implementation very difficult. What is remarked as an eight hour project took me far longer and in the end the system failed to carry out many of the desired functions and I hadn't implemented a MySQL database along side the code. My feedback was satisfactory however, I had managed to demonstrate a lot of what I had learnt, again I felt pleased with my progress. </p>
							
							<p>The NoSQL discussion was the most interesting research project of the module. Getting into and finding out about what on the surface seems a dry topic I found rewarding. I learnt about database modelling, and the way in which the NoSQL does have it's own schema in it's flexible and scaleable way. I revisited MySQL in codio and again found it tricky even thought the MySQL project last module was my most successful.
							Were I to do this module again I would spend more time programming. Practising the concepts on codio and completing tutorial on YouTube. I have found it difficult due to my full time work and unpredictable schedule to get in as much coding practise as I needed. In the past fourteen days I've worked twelve and had two major course work deadlines during this period. It's been difficult but rewarding. In the next module I look forward to the group work element. I think I work well in groups and they motive me to stay on top of my tasks, I look forward to the coming challenges.</p>
