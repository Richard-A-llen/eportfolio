							<p>Hi Rachel. Thanks for your accurate and clear model. Insure design is a broad category which encompasses many different weaknesses but can be expressed as an issue of “missing or ineffective control design” (OWASP,2021). So it was really good to see a specific case example of insure design.  A secure design can still contain implementation defects which can be exploited, but secure design is a culture and methodology that if implemented throughout the course of a project can help identify threats, such as the attack you model, and help to prevent them.<p/>
							<p>It is interesting to consider the trade off between security and convenience and if a the loss of security is worth the convenience it brings.  In the case of the cinema chain, it is conceivable that they could come under an attack like this, for example a group or individual displeased with the showing of a particular movie might launch this kind of attack. According to OWASP a lack of business risk profiling is a factor which contributes to insecure design, resulting in a failure to determine what level of security design is needed for the system (OWASP, 2021) <p/>
