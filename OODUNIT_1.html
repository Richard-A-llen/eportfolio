							<h2>Why use classes</h2>
							<p>Classes are used to logically group data so that it's easy to reuse and also build upon if need be.</p>
							<p> </p>	
							<p>Data and functions associated with classes are called 'attributes' and 'methods'. A method is a funtion within a class. Attributes are the data which is relevant to that class.</p>
							<p>Classes can help to streamline code made it quicker to write. Classes open up the avenue to other object-oriented design methods which I will explore in other posts.</p>
							<h2>Creating an employee class to streamline email address creation using Python classes</h2>
							<p>I'm going to demonstrate Python classes by building a simple class including an attribute which creates a company email address, and a method to return the employees' full name.</p>
							<script src="https://gist.github.com/Richard-A-llen/eaf656b9a17a0a0aad537091bf404313.js"></script>
							<p>In object oriented programing with python the __init__(self) is used as a constructor to create classes which can then be called above or added to later on.</p>
							<p>Functions inside classes are called methods, here I create a method to return the employees full name.</p>
							<p> </p>
							<h2>Instances </h2>
							<p>When objects are created using classes, these objects are refered to as instances. For example here I have inputed the details of four employees using the Employee() class and then requested different details for each employee.
							<script src="https://gist.github.com/Richard-A-llen/893ab4b5eb2c74b379a0107682c93251.js"></script>
							</p>
							<p>Here is the code executed in pycharm which is a dedicated python IDE which I usually use to create python scripts. I exported my code over to my Github page in the form of Gists which I have embeded above. Please feel free to follow the link to my Github profile. </p>

							<p>The attribute self.email, taking emp_1 as its arguement adds emp_1's first name (Ruby) and last name (Shu) with "." between and adds '@company.com' </p>
