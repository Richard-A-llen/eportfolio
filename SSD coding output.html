							<h2>Parameterised queries</h2>

							<p>I wrote this code early on when , according to the design document we were going to use MySQL connector, however the decision was taken in the end to use SQLite. A decision I agree with, however it wasn't a decision we came to in a meeting – a team mate came to the decision and designed our database around SQLite then presented it to the group. So, my original code was defunct, regardless the principle for parametrising the queries is essentially the same, just the execution is different.  My team did a fantastic job of parametrising the quries in SQLite. </p>

							<p>We divided up the security issues early on and I chose SQL injecting prevention, mainly as I had found it an interesting topic of research in the early Collaborative Discussion for UML flowchart. At the time I chose this module to act on I didn't have any idea how to practically stop SQL injection, I will have read about several methods but at the time but I wouldn't have known how to implement it. At the end of this project I feel I have good grasp of the best methods to prevent SQL injection and how to implement them.</p>							
							<h2>UML</h2>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/early UML.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I made an early UML diagram to try to demonstrate to the team and myself how the proposed system could operate. In the end this was not included in the design documentation as other more mature diagrams were produced. </p>
