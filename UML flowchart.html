							<h1>JSON injection attack</h1>

							<p>As others have already noted in this discussion injection attacks are one of the top threats as identified by the OWASP. According to OWASP 2021 report on the most critical web application security risks the injection attack ranked 3rd and 94% of applications had some type of vulnerability to an injection attack (Imperva, 2021). I first encountered the NoSQL injection attack during last module NoSQL alternative discussion, and I wanted to continue my research for this discussion. NoSQL injection attacks are a threat because they manipulate web based applications by injecting malicious code into an application to alter it's normal execution leading to loss of data, modification of data and denial of service. (Welekwe, 2020).</p>
							<p>Web applications often use MongoDB and other NoSQL databases, often include input forms, an attacker can use weaknesses from areas such as input forms to embed malicious code into a NoSQL queries. </p>
							<p>The injection may take the form of a JSON file. JSON files are used by web applications to communicate with databases to retrieve information – they can also be a vulnerable point for an attack. If an attacker can hijack a JSON file and exploit a vulnerability they may bypass firewalls and endpoint defences so the attacker can manipulate the database as an authorised user (Eassa et al, 2018)</p>
							<p>Much of my flowchart is based on the demonstration of a JSON injection attack (Yang, 2021) by Ethical hacker and Cybersecurity consultant Loi Liang Yang please find link to the video in my references.</p>
