							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Task: Create Python shell</h2>
							<p>Review the blogs at Praka (2018) and Szabo (n.d.) and then create a CLI/ shell that implements the following:<br>

								When you enter the command LIST it lists the contents of the current directory<br>
								The ADD command will add the following two numbers together and provide the result<br>
								The HELP command provides a list of commands available<br>
								The EXIT command exits the shell</p>
							<h2>Results</h2>	

							<p>An interactive shell allows the user to run commands one by one. Python is working as an interpretor in this situation. It allows the user to feed the shell commands such as new variables and python will execute the method immediately. It's a powerful function.
	

								The os module of Python provides a function called walk that makes it easy to go over all the directories and files in a directory tree.</p>
							<p>I have use the web version of Jypyter Notebook in Codio as suggested, it is a popular IDE used for Python development. Please see my coding output embedded below.</p>

							<p></p>
							<h2>Testing</h2>
							<p></p>
							<img src="images/Jupyter2.jpg" alt="" />
							<p>Unknown commands return message “*** Unknown syntax:” + the unknown command as demonstrated. However the user can continue to enter another command the “help” command prints a list of Documented and Undocumented commands. Undocumented commands are methods which out a description which can be assessed by the user. Ideally I would have included documentation for each of the methods I added. </p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Jupyter3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>My simple shell was able to add two numbers and exit gracefully.</p>
							<img src="images/Jupyter4.jpg" alt="" />
							<p>I was unable to call the LIST method successfully, I made several different attempts including using the method for traversing a directory tree suggested by Szabo which utilises the os module of Python to provide a function called walk which makes can go over all the directories and files in a directory tree.  </p>
							<p></p>
							<h2>What are the two main security vulnerabilities with your shell?</h2>
							<p>I believe the two main vulnerabilities of this python shell (assuming my LIST method was working) would be:</p>
							<p>First, the shell is vulnerable to a potential a command/code injection attack as currently user input is directly being sent to the interpretor for compiling - a malicious actor could inject code which changes the function of the software.</p> 
							<p>Second, the LIST function could potentially leak more information than it is supposed to, information about the file structure and folder content, especially when combined with an injection attack, this function could give an attacker access to the systems file tree and the files contain within making it far simpler for them to access data that they should not be able to. This shell could potentially compromise a much bigger system.</p>
							<h2>Reference</h2>
							<p>Szabo, (n.d.). Create your own interactive shell with cmd in Python. [online] Available from:<br>https://code-maven.com/interactive-shell-with-cmd-in-python[accessed 20 August 2022]</p>
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>I felt this coding challenge really gave me an opportunity to critically analyse a piece of code and see the potential security problems it had. And I did this without having to spend an hour on research. I did it with the knowledge I had acquired. I know my coding output was very straightforward and also had broken sections such as the LIST function. But, at the same time I was able to complete the task without getting too hung up on what didn't work and I was please I was able to see the shell from a security point of view and not just a functionality point of view. A skill I did not possess at the start of this module. </p>
